	Psychologically, almost all of them were slaves - slaves of faith, slaves of their own kind, slaves of passions, slaves of greed. And if, by the will of fate, one of them was born or became a master, he did not know what to do with his freedom. He again hurried to become a slave - a slave of wealth, unnatural excesses, a slave of dissolute friends, a slave of his slaves.
